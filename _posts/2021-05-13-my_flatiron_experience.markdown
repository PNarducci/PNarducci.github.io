Well, they say all good things must come to an end, and I have finally reached my final Flatiron Blogpost. As an online self paced Data Science student my journey has been a long and interesting one. It's been filled with doubts, excitment, and growth. This blog post is going to talk about my experience in detail - from the pros to the cons - so that future self paced students may use it as a guide to help them through their journey as a Flatiron student. Now, let's start at the beginning.

## Joining Flatiron and the Struggles that Followed
For me, Flatiron fit my lifestyle as a fulltime worker, and family man. The reviews were great, the data was sound, and the corriculim seemed the most fleshed out. I joined Flatiron at the end of July in 2019. I was filled with excitment, hope and was ready to switch careers and become a full time coder. Little did I know that after my first month that my life would get flipped upside down. I had a family concern (which I won't go into much detail here) That caused me to take a hiatus from Flatiron. I also had undiagnosed ADHD, which sadly, has always caused me to not meet deadlines my entire life. My first few months in Flatiron were a complete mess - I struggled to compelte my work, manage my work life, and personal life, and then Covid hit and I was still behind. If I'm going to be honest, I did not complete my first project until an entire year later.

I was seriously in a bad place. I though that there was something fundamentally wrong with me. I was suffering from imposter syndrome, and was really at an all time low. It was hard to be motivated, and even harder to get back up after a hiatus, but some how I found the strength to do so. You see, I may struggle at times, but I don't know how to give up. I always find a way to persevere. 

The thing that really got me out of my Flatiron funk was taking the time to acknowledge that there was something wrong with me. I played with the idea of getting checked for ADHD for many years. Maybe it was the fear of being labeled or different that prevented me from getting checked earlier, but I decided to meet with a doctor and get checked. Lo and behold I was diagnosed with Adult ADHD, put on stimulents, and my whole life began to change. I accomplished what I couldn't do in a year in seven months. All doubt left me, I was producing well designed and though out projects, and I was doing so well that my Online mentors made me a mentor for incomming Flatiron students. My whole world and Flatiron experience changed and I honestly feel like a stronger coder and person beacuse of it.

But, sadly I had to purchase more time in order to complete the program. It was a hard pill to swallow, but I was a better person because of it. I knew my personal struggles and had a label for my demon. The imposter syndrome is now gone and I proud to be a Flatiron graduate. But, if I could do it all over again I would have done things differently.

## Guide to Surviving Self Paced Flatiron
1) Don't worry about completeing the labs yourself. I learned that it was more beneficial to do a code along with each lab exercise. Instead of sitting there for hours and trying to figure it out, It was better to learn from the solution instead of figuring out the solution

2) Talk to your supports. I could not have done this without the help of Jeff or Dara. Whenever I had a concern or problem I would bug them. Don't hesitate to reach out to them. They are wonderful people who geninely want to see us graduate and be successful.

3) Get on Medium and Stack Overflow. Honestly, I learned more about coding from both of these websites than from the corriculum. These websites contain an answer to every coding question know to humankind. Also, you'll learn a lot of amazing techniques and skill that you may not learn from the curriculum.

4) Get to the Module Projects as fast as possible. You will learn more about coding and how to code by doing these projects than toying around with the labs. They will be difficult, but once you figure out your groove, it will all come together. Also, don't be afraid of the projects. They are meant to be a learning experience, There are no right or wrong answers. It's a way to see where you are at and what supports you need moving forward. Take them seriously and try your best.

5) Communicate on slack. I wish I did more of this, during my first half of Flatiron. Things would have gone easier. If you don't know someting, don't hesitate to ask. Flatiron slack channels have a lot of helpful and thoughtful people who are willing to help. It's okay not to know something, but it's not okay not to seek help when you don;t know something. I had to learn that the hard way. Become more active because the online program can be a lonely place.


## What Flatiron Needs to Improve Upon
Now, I wasn't going to end this blog without putting in my two cents about the self paced program. Now, as much as I loved the flexibility of the online program and the depth of the material, I wish there was more for students such as myself. I think what would have helped me succeed was mandatory Monthly check-ins with a coach in order to figure out next steps. I wish there were more interactions with the other slef paced students. Maybe a group project that we had to do with another online student. I feel that missing the human component was a difficulty for me. ANd finally, I wish that the readings for the labs better reflected the labs themselves. For many of the labs the code honestly went over my head, and didn't click for me until I completed my project. I think that's a fault in the curriculum. There is a lot, and you don't honestly need to know all of the stuff listed in the curriculum to actually create a functioning code or model.

## Final Thoughts
Now that everything is done, and I am about to graduate, I just want to say that I appreciated my time here. I've met wonderful people, received amazing support, and even managed to help others along the way. I'm excited for what the future will bring, and I'm sure that Flatiron will continue to become a stronger school that puts knowledgeable students into the working force. Here's to the future and the endless coding to come. Thank you Flatiron for helping me complete a goal and pursue a dream. Best of luck to you, future Data Scienctists who stumble upon this blog post. It will be hard, but in the end worth it.
